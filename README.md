**Silver Coins** is a 2D pixel art platformer that I created for the GMTKJam 2024, themed around the SCALE. This project was a labor of love, taking approximately four days to complete, and it marks my first foray into the world of GMTK jams.

In Silver Coins, you'll navigate through challenging levels and collecting silver to get Bigger.

Engine: Unity 2022
